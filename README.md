# Song Recommendation App

This repository contains a simple web application built with Streamlit that recommends songs based on their genres. It uses cosine similarity to find songs with similar genre profiles from a dataset.

## Features

- **Song Recommendation**: Enter a song name, and the app recommends similar songs based on genre similarity.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Uses cosine similarity to measure genre similarity between songs.
- **Streamlit App**: Provides an interactive web interface for users to explore song recommendations.

## Usage

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/song-recommendation-app.git
   cd song-recommendation-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to use the app.

## Dependencies

The app requires the following Python libraries:

- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

## Data

The dataset used contains song information including track names and genres. Each song's genre is represented as a comma-separated list of genres.

## Example

Here's how the app works:

1. Enter a song name in the input box.
2. The app computes songs with the most similar genres using cosine similarity.
3. It displays a list of recommended songs.

## About

This project was created to demonstrate basic recommendation techniques using genre data. Feel free to contribute or use it as a template for similar applications.
